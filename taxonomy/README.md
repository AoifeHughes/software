# Taxonomy

This will be represented in a programmatic format, but to start is written in this file.
These categories were derived from original discussion [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wDb0udH9OrFWrMBsAVb8RrUMCKKRHoyEep7yveJ1d0k/edit). Note that a piece of software 
that ultimately might not be considered research software (e.g., our Linux or git examples) 
can still be classified here, as it is incidentally used for research.

## Software to directly conduct research -> Domain specific software:
 - Domain-specific hardware (e.g., software for physics to control lab equipment)
 - Domain-specific optimized software (e.g., neuroscience software optimized for GPU)
 - Domain-specific analysis software (e.g., SPM, fsl, afni for neuroscience)

## Software to directly conduct research -> General software:
 - Numerical libraries (includes optimization, statistics, simulation, e.g., numpy)
 - Data collection (e.g., web-based experiments or portals)
 - Visualization (interfaces to interact with, understand, and see data, plotting tools)

## Software to support research -> Explicitly for research:
 - Interactive development environments for research (e.g., Matlab, Jupyter)
 - Workflow managers
 - Provenance and metadata collection tools

## Software to support research -> Used for research, but not explicitly for it
 - Databases
 - Application programming interfaces
 - Frameworks (to generate documentation, content management systems, etc.)

## Software to support research -> Incidentally used for research (not considered RSEng software)
 - Operating Systems
 - Scheduling and task management (for people)
 - Version Control
 - Text Editors
 - Communication/collaboration tools or platforms (e.g., email, slack, journals, etc.)
